OOP Concepts

1. Inheritance
Child have all properties and behaviors of parents.
Example: Class Suzuka extends Motorcycle.
Class Motorcycle have property color, Class Suzuka also have property color

2. Polymorphism
One form can be change to another form.
Example:
Motorcycle motor1 = new Suzuka();
Motorcycle motor2 = new Hondo();

3. Abstraction
Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. For example phone call, we don't know the internal processing.

In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.

4. Encapsulation
This is the practice of keeping fields within a class private, then providing access to them via public methods. Itâ€™s a protective barrier that keeps the data and code safe within the class itself.
Example:
private String brand;
public String getBrand();
public void setBrand(String brand);
